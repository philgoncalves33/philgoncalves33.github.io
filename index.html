              <p>Sao Paulo Futebol Clube (SPFC), commonly refered to as Sao Paulo, is a professional football club in the Morumbi district of Sao Paulo, Brazil, founded in 1930.  They play in the Campeonato Paulista (the State of Sao Paulo's Premier state league) and Campeonato Brasiliero (the top tier of the Brazilian football league system.</p>
              <p>SPFC is the most successful team in Brazil, with 12 international titles.  It is also one of the most successful South American clubs with 21 state titles, six Brasileirão titles, three Copa Libertadores titles, one Copa Sudamericana, one Supercopa Libertadores, one Copa CONMEBOL, one Copa Masters CONMEBOL, two Recopa Sudamericanas, two Intercontinental Cups, and one FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
              <p>SPFC was an inaugural member of the Clube dos 13 group of Brazil's leading football clubs.  The club's most consistent spell of success came in the 1990s under coach Telê Santana when it won three state titles, one national championship, two Copa Libertadores, two Recopa Sudamericana, a Copa CONMEBOL, and a Copa Masters CONMEBOL.</p>
              <p>Sao Paulo is the third best-supported club in Brazil, with over 16 million supporters.  The team's traditional home kit is a white shirt with two horizontal stripes (one red and one black), white shorts, and white socks.  Its home ground is the 67,052-seater called Morumbi football stadium in Sao Paulo, where it has been played since 1960.  The stadium was the venue for the Copa Libertadores finals of 1992, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2006.  Sao Paulo is the second richest Brazilian club, worth over $353.4 million in 2011.</p>

          </a></p>
              <p>Sao Paulo's stadium is officially named Estádio Cícero Pompeu de Toledo (Cicero Pompeu de Toledo Stadium) and commonly known by the nickname Estádio do Morumbi (Morumbi Stadium). It was inaugurated in 1960, with a maximum sitting capacity of 120,000 people, but now its maximum capacity is only 67,011 seats. Its record attendance for a football match, set in 1977, is 146,082.</p>
              <p>The club also owns two training grounds, one named Centro de Treinamento Frederico Antônio Germano Menzen (Frederico Antônio Germano Menzen Training Center), nicknamed Centro de Treinamento (CT) da Barra Funda (Barra Funda's Training Center), which is used mostly by the professional team.  The other is the Centro de Formação de Atletas Presidente Laudo Natel (President Laudo Natel Athletes Formation Center), nicknamed Centro de Treinamento (CT) de Cotia (Cotia's Training Center), which is used by the youth teams.</p>
          <h2>Colours and Badge</h2>
            <p><a href="https://blog.paulistacartoes.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/evolucao-escudo.png">

          </a></p>
              <p>When Club Athletico Paulistano and Associação Atlética das Palmeiras merged, forming Sao Paulo Futebol Clube, their colours (red and white for Paulistano and black and white for Palmeiras) were inherited by São Paulo. The colours match those of São Paulo's state flag, and also represent the three main races that lived in Brazil during that period: the Native Americans (represented by the red), the Europeans (represented by the white) and the Africans (represented by the black).</p>
              <p>The club's home kit is a white shirt, with two horizontal stripes at chest level, the upper one red and the lower one black, and with a badge in the centre of the chest. The shorts and socks are all-white. The away kit consists of a red shirt with red, black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and socks.</p>
              <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsaopaulofc%2Fvideos%2F2618624854933354%2F&show_text=0&width=380" width="380" height="476" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
              <p>The black, red and white colors come from the two clubs that merged in 1930 to form SPFC, and also from the city flag. The stars atop the shield are more interesting. The three red stars symbolize the club world championships won by the Brazilian powerhouse. That’s typical usage. The two in yellow likely are unique, however, because they have nothing to do with soccer. They honor the world and Olympic records set in the 1950s by São Paulo triple jumper Adhemar Ferreira da Silva.</p>

          <h2>The Myth: Rogério Ceni</h2>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KtTbfvrMfUA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              <p>Rogério Mücke Ceni is considered the best player to ever play for Sao Paulo. Most of his vast professional career, which had spanned 25 years and 1,257 professional club matches, was associated with São Paulo, with which he won 20 major titles, including three Brazilian Leagues, two Copa Libertadores and the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
              <p>He also scored 131 goals during his career, with most of them coming from free kicks and penalties and one coming from open play.  He is recognised by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics as the goalkeeper to have scored the most goals in the history of football.</p>
              <p>Ceni also represented Brazil 16 times over the course of his career, being part of the squads that won the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, and also taking part at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.</p>
              <p>A dead-ball specialist, Ceni was the official taker of free kicks and penalties for São Paulo from 1997 until his retirement, a time period in which he scored 131 goals.  In addition to his accurate set-pieces, prolific goalscoring, distribution, and ability with the ball at his feet, he was also known as an excellent goalkeeper and shot-stopper, and stood out for his determination and longevity throughout his career, as he retired with over 40 years of age.  Ceni was known for being capable of producing brilliant saves, such as those in the final of the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship, which saw São Paulo defeat Liverpool 1–0; for his performances, Ceni later won the Golden Ball, which is awarded to the competition's best player.</p>
              <p>Ceni is considered one of the all-time greatest Brazilian goalkeepers.</p>
